/**
 `NetworkServiceProviding` provides access to remote resources. It should be used as an abstraction for all outgoing network resource.
 
 **Abstract different layers**
 
Builing layerd network abstraction can be very easy, when all layers conform to `NetworkServiceProviding`.
 By doing so composing different features into a layerd system becomes very easy.
 
 **Example**
 ```swift
 //Baselayer, which executes network calls
 let networkService: NetworkServiceProviding = NetworkService(networkAccess: URLSession(configuration: .default))
 
 //Imaginary CachedNetworkService, which is able to look up cached resources
 let cachedNetworkService: NetworkServiceProviding = CachedNetworkService(networkService: networkService)
 
 //Add Auth tokens to each request
 let autheticationNetworkService = ModifyRequestNetworkService(networkService: cachedNetworkService, requestModifications: [{ $0.addAuthetication() }])
 ```
 
 - note: `NetworkServiceProviding` is good extension point for adding support for other async concpets like Result types, feature/promise, etc.
 */
public protocol NetworkServiceProviding {
    /**
     Fetches a resource asynchronously from remote location.
     One can specify a queue where completeion or error block is called.
     
     **Example**
     ```swift
     
     let networkService: NetworkServiceProviding = //
     let resource: Resource<String> = //
     
     networkService.request(resource, onCompletionWithResponse: { htmlText, response in
        print(htmlText)
     }, onError: { error in
        //Handle errors
     })
     ```
     
     - note: Use convience methods if you are not intrested in the `HTTPURLResponse`.
     
     - note: Use convience methods if completion/error block should be allways called on the main queue.
     
     - parameter queue: The DispatchQueue to execute the completion and error block on.
     - parameter resource: The resource you want to fetch.
     - parameter onCompletionWithResponse: Callback which gets called when fetching and tranforming into model succeeds.
